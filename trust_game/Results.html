    You chose to send Player 2 <strong>{{ group.sent_amount }}.</strong>
    Player 2 returned <strong>{{ group.sent_back_amount }}.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    You were initially endowed with <strong>Ksh. {{ C.AMOUNT_GIVEN }}.</strong>,
    chose to send {{ group.sent_amount }} to Player 2,
    and received {{ group.sent_back_amount }} back.
    Thus, you have {{ C.AMOUNT_GIVEN }} - {{ group.sent_amount }} + {{ group.sent_back_amount }} = <strong>Ksh. {{
    player.payoff }}</strong>
</p>

{{ else }}
<p>
    Player 1 sent you <strong>{{ group.sent_amount }}.</strong>
    The amount was tripled and you received <strong>{{ tripled_amount }}.</strong>
    You chose to send back <strong>Ksh. {{ group.sent_back_amount }}.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    You received <strong>Ksh. {{ tripled_amount }}</strong>,
    chose to send back <strong>Ksh. {{ group.sent_back_amount }}</strong>,
    thus you now have {{ tripled_amount }} - {{ group.sent_back_amount }} = <strong>Ksh. {{ player.payoff }}.</strong>
