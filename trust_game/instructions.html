<h2>Instruction to Player</h2>

<p>
    You have been randomly paired with another player.
    One of you will be selected as Player 1 and the other as Player 2.
    You will learn whether you are Player 1 or Player 2 by before the game starts
</p>

<p>
    To start, Player 1 will receive Ksh. {{C.AMOUNT_GIVEN}} and Player 2 will receive NOTHING.
    Player 1 can choose to send some or all of his {{C.AMOUNT_GIVEN}} to Player 2.
    Before Player 2 receives this amount, it will be multiplied by {{C.MULTIPLIER}}.
    Once Player 2 receives the amount, he can choose to send some or all of it to Player 1.
